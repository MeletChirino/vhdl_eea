In this file you're going to find vhdl files and TP vhdl files with simulations and graphics

## GHDL
All VHDL circuits written in this repo has been simulated using [GHDL](http://ghdl.free.fr/) which is an open source simulator for vhdl available for Linux, Windows and Apple OS X. That's why in every folder with file you're going to find a file `_tb.vhdl` and a `Makefile`. If you're not using GHDL to simulate your files you can ignore those files.
